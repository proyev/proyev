# Hi there, I'm Yevhen üëã

- üá©üá™ Based in Berlin, Germany.
- üë∑ I'm a software engineer at [Autobahn-Security](https://autobahn-security.com/) by day and freelancing by night.
- üë®‚Äçüíª Most of the time code in JavaScript/TypeScript, less often in Python.
- ü™© When not coding, you can find me biking on the streets of Berlin, on a wall bouldering, listening to or looking for some vinyl.

## Some of my projects üöß

### Lorem Ipsum

No, it's not a typo or just a placeholder, and yes, figuring out a proper name for your variables is not the only difficulty...

Introducing, Lorem Ipsum - a web application([client](https://github.com/proyev/LoremIpsum-Client) & [server](https://github.com/proyev/LoremIpsum-Server)) designed to streamline the job-finding process for users. The platform encompasses CV generation, interview preparation, and application tracking. Users can create, customize, and refine their CVs using our built-in ATS system, which analyzes their profiles and offers feedback for improvement. There is also OpenAI GPT-3 integrated to help users prepare for interviews.

[Application walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDUdlnxxFIA) 

P.S. back then GPT-4 had not yet been released, soo, a bit of a legacy here:)

### Whishing well

An NLP-based postcard generator, that uses [BERT](!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) under the hood and has a client written in Angular to generate postcards in different styles for various events. The model was pre-trained on William Shakespeare books, and different other data to generate different results.

### [total.recall](https://github.com/proyev/totall.recall)

[total.recall](https://github.com/proyev/totall.recall) - is a small yet fun tool to recall your knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Available soon...

### [termin.finder](https://github.com/proyev/termin_finder)

[termin.finder](https://github.com/proyev/termin_finder) - finding a government appointment in Berlin can be a nightmare. To ease this hell at least for myself, an extension is currently under development. 

MVP - get a Anmeldung and related.
Ideal goal - to provide a simple option to find an appointment for everything provided.

### [highlander](https://github.com/proyev/highlander)

There ~~can~~ will be only one - only one place to figure out, replicate, visualize and explain all the important algorithms and data structures in simple language.
